This is now the feature branch for the second feature.

All of the feature development will happen here.

The new feature will peel the carrots and maybe even chop them.

The development team is most definitely as cool as a cucumber.

There is a very small amount of lettuce at home.

I would like for feature 2 to have a carrot.

Maybe we could peel carrots with it.
